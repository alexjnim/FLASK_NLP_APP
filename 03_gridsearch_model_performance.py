test_text = 'Food and drink supplies in the UK face more disruption after the end of the Brexit transition period than they did from Covid, the industry has said. There are 14 [working] days to go, the Food and Drink Federations (FDF) chief executive, Ian Wright, told MPs. How on earth can traders prepare in this environment he added. Noting that rules for sending goods from Welsh ports to Northern Ireland had only just been published, he said: Its too late, baby. Uncertainty over a deal and new border checks would make it difficult to guarantee the movement of food through ports without delays, he said. Mr Wright was giving evidence to the Commons business committee on Brexit preparedness. He said there was a big concern that the problems would erode the confidence of shoppers in the supply chain, adding: It has done very well over Covid and shoppers will expect the same thing over Brexit, and they may not see it. PM: Sweet reason can get us to post-Brexit deal NI food supply warnings taken very seriously No clue We cant be absolutely certain about the movement of food from the EU to the UK from 1 January for two reasons, Mr Wright said. One is checks at the border. The other is tariffs, and the problem with tariffs is, we dont know what they will be. Mr Wright added: With just 14 working days to go, we have no clue whats going to happen in terms of whether we do or dont face tariffs. And that isnt just a big imposition. Its a binary choice as to whether you do business in most cases. My members will not know whether theyre exporting their products after 1 January, or whether theyll be able to afford to import them and charge the price that the tariff will dictate. Mr Wright warned that while he expected Kent and Operation Brock to work "reasonably well", he was less confident about ports such as Holyhead, with goods heading to Northern Ireland.'

text = 'Boris Johnson will fly to Brussels later for talks on a post-Brexit deal with the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. The pair will hold talks over dinner, after negotiations between officials ended in deadlock. Major disagreements remain on fishing rights, business competition rules and how a deal will be policed. At the dinner, expected to begin at 19:00 GMT, Prime Minister Johnson will work through a list of the major sticking points with Mrs von der Leyen, who is representing the leaders of the 27 EU nations. A UK government source said progress at a political level may allow the negotiations - between the UK\'s Lord Frost and EU\'s Michel Barnier - to resume over the coming days.'
